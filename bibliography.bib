Yet, detecting factors that reduce the use of cars is a serious challenge, particularly across different regions. Here, we model the use of various modes of transport in a city by aggregating Active mobility (A), Public Transport (B) and Cars (C), expressing the modal share of a city by its ABC triplet. Data for nearly 800 cities across 61 countries is used to model car use and its relationship with city size and income. Our findings suggest that with longer distances and the congestion experienced in large cities, Active mobility and journeys by Car are less frequent, but Public Transport is more prominent. Further, income is strongly related to the use of cars. Results show that a city with twice the income has 37% more journeys by Car. Yet, there are significant differences across regions. For cities in Asia, Public Transport contributes to a substantial share of their journeys. For cities in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, most of their mobility depends on Cars, regardless of city size. In Europe, there are vast heterogeneities in their modal share, from cities with mostly Active mobility (like Utrecht) to cities where Public Transport is crucial (like Paris or London) and cities where more than two out of three of their journeys are by Car (like Rome and Manchester).},

Specifically, we employ social network analysis to investigate whether migration flows move between countries with similar or dissimilar levels of income and inequality, across 41 European countries. We observe that emigration flows move between more unequal to less unequal countries and find indications of two migration regimes: one reflecting the movement predominantly between EU-15 member states and another propelled by per-capita income differences for the migrants from other countries in Europe. As the first study to investigate the relationship between inequality and migration flows within a network, rather than considering the flows as unrelated to each other, it significantly contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between inequality and migration.},

    convergence is about 2.7 per cent. An increase of one percentage point in the
    net migration rate of a region increases the per capita income growth rate in
    that region on average by about 0.1 percentage points. Introducing a net
    migration variable in a growth regression increases the estimate of beta
    convergence slightly. Studies that use panel models or IV estimation methods
    yield smaller coefficients of net migration in growth regressions, while the
    opposite holds for regressions controlling for highskilled migration. Resumen
    Comparamos un conjunto de estudios econométricos que miden el efecto de la
    migración interna neta en modelos neoclásicos de convergencia de ingresos
    reales a largo plazo y de ahí obtenemos 67 tamaños de efectos comparables. La
    estimación ponderada por precisión de la betaconvergencia es aproximadamente
    del 2.7 por ciento. Un aumento de un punto porcentual en la tasa de migración
    neta de una región aumenta la tasa de crecimiento de ingresos per cápita en
    dicha región en un promedio de aproximadamente 0.1 puntos porcentuales. El
    introducir una variable de migración neta en una regresión de crecimiento
    aumenta ligeramente el valor estimado de betaconvergencia. Los estudios que
    usan modelos de panel o métodos de estimación por VI producen coeficientes
    menores de migración neta en regresiones de crecimiento, mientras que sucede
    lo contrario para regresiones que controlan migración altamente cualificada.
